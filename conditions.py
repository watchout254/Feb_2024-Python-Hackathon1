# Create a Python program that:

# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."
print("Very warm welcome to Mukenyas Registration Voters card")

age = int(input("Kindly enter your age: "));

if age >= 18:
    print("Wonderful, You are eligible to vote");
else:
    print("Oooops!!Sorry you can't vote my guy,wait till you reach 18 years");
